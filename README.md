## Project Overview
Medical image classification plays a crucial role in healthcare by helping in early disease detection and diagnosis. This project uses ResNet-D to classify lung conditions based on X-ray scans. With advanced training methodologies and data augmentation, the model improved accuracy and robustness.

## Dataset
The model uses the [COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/covid19-radiography-dataset), which includes X-ray images for:
- COVID-19 positive cases
- Normal cases
- Viral Pneumonia cases
- Lung Opacity cases

## Results
The model achieved high accuracy across different dataset splits, with the 80/20 split yielding the best results.<br>By using model improvements like advanced learning rate and data augmentation, the model shows a significant improvement with 20% data augmented.
